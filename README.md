# ConZWNetwork Research 🔬

</div>

> ​**❗ Important Notice**  
> This tool is the official implementation of the paper *"ConZWNet: A Contrastive Learning-based Zero-Watermark Network for High Robustness and Distinguishability"*.
> The source code will be fully released upon the paper's official acceptance. Stay tuned!

## 🚀 How to Use

1. ​**📥 Download the Tool**  
   Click the link below to download the latest `zip` file:  
   [📦 ConZWNetwork_Valid.zip](https://github.com/hanhongxin1028/ConZWNetwork_Valid/releases/download/v1.0/ConZWNet_valid.zip)

2. ​**📂 File Description**  
   - `zeroWatermarkTest.exe`: The main executable file for running the tool.  
   - `test_images/`: A folder containing test images required for running the tool.  
   - `README.md`: The user guide document, including detailed instructions and notes.  
   - `weights/`: A folder containing pre-trained weights required by the model.

3. ​**🛠️ Usage Steps**  
   - ​**Step 1**: Extract the downloaded `zip` file.  
   - ​**Step 2**: Double-click to open `zeroWatermarkTest.exe`.  
   - ​**Step 3**: Upload three corresponding images as prompted (a set of test cases is provided in the `test_images` folder).  
   - ​**Step 4**: Click `Run Robustness Test` to evaluate the network's performance.  
   - ​**Step 5**: View the results:  
     - `Pred Copyright Label` indicates the label of the uploaded copyright image.  
     - `NC` represents the similarity between the two zero-watermarks.
